I am currently a Senior Researcher at [The Voleon Group](https://voleon.com/) - a Machine Learning driven quantitative hedge fund. Before moving to industy, I obtained my PhD in Mathematics from the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/), advised by [Sir Martin Hairer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Hairer) in Stochastic PDEs and Rough Path Theory. I subsequently held postdoctoral positions at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/) and the [University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill](https://math.unc.edu/), before becoming a Courant Instructor / Assistant Professor at the [Courant Institute](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/), NYU.
